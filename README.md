# Urban-Landscape-Classifier

## intro

Urban landscapes are often classified into hubs, points, and corridors, each with distinct public programs and biodiversity. The characteristics of these elements are defined in relation to the context and scale of the surrounding environment. This project focuses on conducting real-time comparisons between identified green spaces to generate specific cinfidence scaore tailored to the selected region and scale for form analysis. Looking ahead, the script can be adapted for individual developers to facilitate communication, aid in infrastructure planning, and create phasing strategies. Additionally, it offers a platform for users to engage in the planning and zoning of public spaces, fostering connectivity within the community.

## Setup

The script was previously developed inside Google Colab. Please follow the instructions within the file step by step, and all the necessary libraries and datasets will be installed along the way. It is also suggested to run the script on your Colab since the ML models might take some time to set up for the first time.

## What's Next

The script assists in the detection of landscape typology, and enhancing the efficiency and processing speed will be the next goal to address. Additionally, after speaking with landscape architects, the categorization of plant species will be the next potential data to be added to the pipeline, adding a new dimension to the analysis.
